Lab Environment:
This project is tested in a simulated environment (Node-RED, virtual PLC, virtual SCADA).
Real industrial deployments may behave differently.

Timing Constraints:
The proxy does not model real-time constraints. In real OT networks, latency or jitter may impact
process stability or trigger alarms.

Protocol Coverage:
Only Modbus TCP is covered. Serial Modbus (RTU/ASCII) and secured variants are out of scope.

No Detection Mechanisms : 
This lab does not simulate:
- Industrial IDS : This will be implemented in future Lab to detect that threat.
- DPI firewalls
- Anomaly detection systems
