# Threat Model – Modbus TCP Transparent Proxy

## Scope:
This threat model applies to classic Modbus TCP deployments
in flat OT networks without additional security controls.

## No Authentication:
Modbus TCP does not provide any mechanism to authenticate
clients or servers. Any host able to reach TCP port 502
can send read or write requests to a PLC.

## No Encryption:
Modbus TCP exchanges data in clear text.
Requests and responses can be intercepted, observed,
or proxied without detection.

## Flat Network Assumption:
Many OT environments rely on flat Layer 2 or Layer 3 networks,
where traffic redirection (DNAT, ARP spoofing, routing changes)
can be performed without alerting industrial devices.

## No Message Integrity:
Modbus TCP does not ensure message integrity or replay protection.
Responses are trusted as long as they match the expected format.

## Why This Matters:
This lab demonstrates how protocol design assumptions
can be abused without exploiting software vulnerabilities.
