In a transparent Modbus/TCP MITM architecture using DNAT and an application-level proxy, identical Modbus requests may appear multiple times in packet captures.

This is expected behavior and results from:

            - NAT packet rewriting (same packet observed before and after DNAT)

            - Application-level proxying, where Modbus requests and responses are terminated and re-emitted over new TCP connections

              Each Modbus payload may therefore appear several times while belonging to distinct TCP flows.
